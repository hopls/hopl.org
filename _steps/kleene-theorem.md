Kleene presented (and proved) a theorem which states that if a language can be defined by any one of the
three ways, then it can be defined by the other two.

All three of these methods of defining languages are equivalent:

Any language that can be defined by:

• regular expression, or

• finite automaton, or

• transition graph

can be defined by all three methods.
